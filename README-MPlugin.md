MPlugin, or, How to extend Maratis.
===================================

Creating a plugin for Maratis is easy, just check the example in examples/plugin to see how simple.
As you probably don't want to make the wrong move and recompile the whole of Maratis each time, I would suggest using the structure within the example folder, rather than attempting to compile it within the Maratis/MIngEd source tree. However, if you wish to do the latter, the code is identical. Just modify the build scripts to allow for the header/library locations
